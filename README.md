# Welcome to Trivia-Challege

An online / self-hostable - multi-player trivia game where you control the questions, answers, and options for the game.

## Documentation

The GitHub Wiki for this repo has the install and setup instructions.  You can find them at
- [Download and Install Trivia-Challenge](https://github.com/bmcgonag/trivia-challenge/wiki/Downloading-and-Installing)

How to create and join games should be pretty straight forward, but there are instructions as well. You can find them at:
- [About Playing Trivia-Challenge](https://github.com/bmcgonag/trivia-challenge/wiki/About-Trivia-Challenge)

I hope you enjoy the game, and I'll be trying to improve it as I go, so check back for updates.  If you'd like to contribute feel free to clone, and make a pull request.

I have recently added the ability to import questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) as well.
